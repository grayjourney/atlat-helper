"""
Agents Module - LangGraph Orchestration

Contains:
- state.py: Agent state definitions (TypedDict)
- graph.py: LangGraph workflow builder
- nodes/: Individual processing nodes

This module defines HOW the agent thinks and acts.
LangGraph provides a state machine for AI agents.

Think of it like:
- Go: A workflow engine with defined states and transitions
- PHP: A pipeline of handlers (like Laravel's Pipeline)
